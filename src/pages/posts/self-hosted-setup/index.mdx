	<p>Hosting all the things from a closet.</p>
</hgroup>

I've always had a media server setup running in our house, but during the pandemic I got much more interested in self hosting various services.  This list of self hosted applications on my home server changes all the time.

<div class="ui segment">
<Diagram />
</div>



_With the exception of Snapraid and MergerFS these are all running in docker and are accessed in a browser._

{data.apps.map((app) => (
	<div class="text-black mt-4 border-1 rounded-md border-gray-200 shadow-sm p-4">
	<div class="flex justify-between">
		<a href={app.url}>{app.app}</a>
	</div>
	<p>{app.description}</p>
</div>
))}
