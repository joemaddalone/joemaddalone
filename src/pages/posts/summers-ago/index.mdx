	<p>A meditation on time, technology, and the ephemeral nature of digital progress</p>
</hgroup>

Time has a curious way of compressing itself in the digital age. What feels like yesterday in our collective memory spans decades in the real world. The internet, that vast digital ocean we now navigate daily, has its own seasons - summers of innovation, winters of consolidation, springs of disruption.

Let me take you on a journey through these digital summers, measured not in years but in the rhythm of seasons that have passed since each milestone shaped our connected world.

## The Wild-eyed Dreamers

**<SummersAgo year={1943} />**, Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts dared to imagine that the brain itself could be understood as a computer - a revolutionary idea that would shape decades of digital thinking.

**<SummersAgo year={1945} />**, Vannevar Bush described the memex in 'As We May Think'. A prophetic vision of the future, where a library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk - the dream that would eventually become our reality.

## The Dawn of Connection

**<SummersAgo year={1968} />**,largely based on the work of Vannevar Bush, Douglas Engelbart demonstrates the first mouse and graphical user interface.

**<SummersAgo year={1969} />**, the first ARPANET link was established. In the heat of that summer, few could have imagined that this simple connection would become the foundation of everything we know as the internet today.

**<SummersAgo year={1970} />**, the first-ever computer-to-computer chat occurred. Two machines, separated by distance but united by curiosity, exchanged their first digital words.

**<SummersAgo year={1971} />**, Ray Tomlinson sent the first email. That "@" symbol, now so ubiquitous in our daily lives, made its debut in the digital lexicon.

## The Birth of Networks

**<SummersAgo year={1974} />**, the term "Internet" was born. A word that would come to define an entire era of human communication and collaboration.

**<SummersAgo year={1983} />**, the Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced. Suddenly, the internet had addresses that humans could remember - a small but crucial step toward making the digital world accessible to everyone.

**<SummersAgo year={1989} />**, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. In a single summer, the foundation was laid for everything we now take for granted about how we access and share information.

## The Commercial Revolution

**<SummersAgo year={1994} />**, Yahoo was founded. The internet was becoming a place where businesses could thrive, not just researchers could collaborate.

**<SummersAgo year={1995} />**, Amazon and eBay were launched. E-commerce was born, forever changing how we think about shopping and commerce.

**<SummersAgo year={1998} />**, Google was founded. A search engine that would become so central to our digital lives that "googling" became a verb.

## The Social Era

**<SummersAgo year={2004} />**, Facebook was founded. Social networking moved from niche communities to mainstream culture.

**<SummersAgo year={2005} />**, YouTube was launched. Suddenly, everyone could be a broadcaster, sharing their stories with the world.

**<SummersAgo year={2007} />**, the iPhone was released, bringing the internet to mobile. The digital world was no longer confined to desks and offices - it was in our pockets.

**<SummersAgo year={2010} />**, Instagram was launched. Visual storytelling became the dominant form of digital communication.

## The Remote Era

**<SummersAgo year={2020} />**, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an internet usage surge. The digital world became not just convenient, but essential for maintaining human connection.

**<SummersAgo year={2022} />**, remote work became the norm. The internet transformed from a tool for entertainment and information into the backbone of our professional lives.

## The AI Winter ends

**<SummersAgo year={2022} />**, ChatGPT was released. In a single summer, artificial intelligence moved from the realm of science fiction into our daily conversations, forever changing how we think about creativity, knowledge, and what it means to be human in an age of machines.


## Reflections on Digital Time

Each of these summers represents a moment when the world shifted, when the impossible became possible, when the future arrived a little bit sooner than expected. But time moves differently in the digital realm. What feels like ancient history  -  the dot-com bubble bursting, the rise of social media, the mobile revolution  -  happened in the span of just a few digital summers.

The internet has compressed time itself. Ideas that once took decades to spread now propagate in hours. Technologies that once required years of development can be built in months. The pace of change has accelerated to the point where each summer brings new revolutions, new disruptions, new ways of being human in a connected world.

As we stand here today, looking back at these digital summers, we're reminded that the internet is still young. The most transformative innovations may still be ahead of us, waiting in future summers to reshape our world once again.

The question isn't just what happened summers ago - it's what will happen summers from now, when our current innovations become the ancient history of tomorrow's digital natives.
