	<p>my list of lesser-discussed rewatchable films</p>
</hgroup>

I enjoy listening to a variety of podcasts and shows that delve into film discussions, with some favorites like [The Rewatchables](https://www.theringer.com/the-rewatchables), [Film Sack](https://www.frogpants.com/filmsack), [Red Letter Media](https://www.youtube.com/redlettermedia/), and [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/@everyframeapainting). While I find their takes on classic films engaging, I've noticed that some of my personal favorite movies rarely get mentioned. With that in mind, I’ve compiled a list of films I consider rewatchable, but that don't often make it into popular discussions.
