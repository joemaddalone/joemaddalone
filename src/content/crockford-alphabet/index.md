The alphabet is a set of symbols that represent sounds. The letters of the alphabet are the symbols that we use to represent the sounds of our language. The letters are not the sounds. The letters are the symbols of the sounds.


## Some pronunciations are hard to say

The letter C is pronounced as S in the word "city" and as K in the word "cat".  The letter X is pronounced as Z in the word "xylophone" and as KS in the word "box".  The letter Q is pronounced as KW in the word "queen".  These are dumb rules.  They are hard to remember.  They are hard to say.  They are hard to teach.  They are hard to learn.  They are hard to use.  They are hard to love.

## Mr. Crockford

Douglas Crockford takes issue with the way we "sound" letters.  Douglas Crockford has a solution to this problem.  Douglas Crockford has a solution to every problem.

## The New Alphabet

How to "sound" the letters of the alphabet:

```

```

## How to "sound" these words:

### Programmer

### Crockford

I love these sounds.  And Crockford.  You are welcome
