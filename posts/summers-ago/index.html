<hgroup><h1>Summers ago…</h1><p>A meditation on time, technology, and the ephemeral nature of digital progress</p></hgroup>
<p>Time has a curious way of compressing itself in the digital age. What feels like yesterday in our collective memory spans decades in the real world. The internet, that vast digital ocean we now navigate daily, has its own seasons - summers of innovation, winters of consolidation, springs of disruption.</p>
<p>Let me take you on a journey through these digital summers, measured not in years but in the rhythm of seasons that have passed since each milestone shaped our connected world.</p>

<h2 id="reflections-on-digital-time">Reflections on Digital Time</h2>
<p>Each of these summers represents a moment when the world shifted, when the impossible became possible, when the future arrived a little bit sooner than expected. But time moves differently in the digital realm. What feels like ancient history  -  the dot-com bubble bursting, the rise of social media, the mobile revolution  -  happened in the span of just a few digital summers.</p>
<p>The internet has compressed time itself. Ideas that once took decades to spread now propagate in hours. Technologies that once required years of development can be built in months. The pace of change has accelerated to the point where each summer brings new revolutions, new disruptions, new ways of being human in a connected world.</p>
<p>As we stand here today, looking back at these digital summers, we’re reminded that the internet is still young. The most transformative innovations may still be ahead of us, waiting in future summers to reshape our world once again.</p>
<p>The question isn’t just what happened summers ago - it’s what will happen summers from now, when our current innovations become the ancient history of tomorrow’s digital natives.</p>
