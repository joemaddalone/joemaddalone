It is used to indicate that two or more numbers or quantities should be added together to get a sum. For example, the expression 5 + 3 means &quot;5 plus 3&quot; and is equal to 8.</p><pre><code>Plus:
1: algebraically positive
2: having, receiving, or being in addition to what is anticipated
3: falling high in a specified range; a grade of C plus
4: electrically positive
</code></pre><p>It would seem that in some of these cases plus actually makes sense. If a service or product already exists and this new service is in addition to that service or product, or a more &quot;premium&quot; version of that service. Apple TV is a service (and a device maybe?), Apple TV + is in addition to that service. However, the addition of addition (+) usually adds up to nothing more than imitation and fad.</p><h3>Concerning brand name fads</h3><p>Once upon a time everything got an &quot;e&quot; as in &quot;electronic&quot; prepended to it. eBanking, eFax, eHarmony. This mostly made sense in that the service was an electronic version of a non-digital service or product. Banking, but electronic. Dating, but electronic. Fax machines, but electronic-er. And this usually made more sense than the &quot;i&quot; branding that followed it... iPhone, iPlayer, iBank... did anyone ever ask what the fucking &quot;i&quot; stood for? &quot;net&quot; made some amount of sense too. &quot;web&quot; was another branding fad that came and went... mostly... WebMD is still going pretty strong.</p><h3>Why &quot;+&quot;?</h3><div class="ui small left floated image mpa3"><img src="/assets/InaQLEPI08-800.d50f5f61.jpeg" alt="Google Plus" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></div><p>I mostly blame Google. Once upon a time Google launched a social network called, you guessed it, &quot;Google +&quot;. They took an existing logo and slapped two lines on it to name a service that had absolutely nothing to do with their core business. It was, for me, the birth of plus branding being more like a disclosure that &quot;this isn't really what we do&quot;. Not at all premium, but some extra stuff we had lying around. Google + was deducted from Google's offerings just as lazily.</p><h3>Lazy +</h3><p>The latest lazy craze to append or prepend is &quot;+&quot; and that laziness is in full swing. Just call it &quot;our thing +&quot; for the few months it will exist until we sell it to &quot;their thing +&quot; and then they can deal with it. The standard shortsightedness it represents is probably what irks me the most. In almost every case the &quot;plus&quot; branding that is meant to identify an addition to a previously existing service or product is doomed to represent the death of said service or product. eBanking becomes banking, TV+ becomes TV, and Widget+ will not resemble Widget at all.</p><p>Will we really need a &quot;Discovery +&quot; when there is no one left who remembers what it was &quot;in addition&quot; to?</p></main><footer class="flex justify-between"><div>I'm Joe Maddalone</div><div><i>This is not a blog, these pages are changed all the time.</i></div></footer><style></style></body></html>
