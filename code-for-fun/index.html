	<h1>Code for fun</h1>
	<p>building to abandon</p>
</hgroup>
<p>I was building a thing and at v0.06 I kinda forgot what I was intending to build.  Shit.  I was once again in the presence of a project I was going to bail on.  I’d write a few comments, make a half-hearted attempt at ear-marking the code as the utmost important thing to get to… when I had more time to think.  This led to some internal guilt.  Then wondered why I was building it at all?  Why do I even bother?</p>
<p>I went back and looked at the iterations of the code and deduced that my intent was to learn.</p>
<p>And this is the basis of my relationship with coding as a hobby.  When not for work I code to learn, and indeed I had learned some new bits and pieces while building this thing I may or may not ever finish… or may have never intended to finish.  Sometimes just learning what it would take to fully complete the project is enough.</p>
<p>This led to the following mental models of my flow when I code in my free time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanic</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mastery of the tools that exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual</strong>
<ul>
<li>A deep understanding of the tools that exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wizard</strong>
<ul>
<li>Creating new tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kiddie</strong>
<ul>
<li>I just want to push all the buttons, pull all the levers, and see what they do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I have many more of these in horrible and outdated shape that I would never bother to share, but these few are reasonable examples of code I took to a good enough point.  As in good enough for whatever I needed at the time.  They could all be improved in various ways… and I may or may not ever get to those improvements.  And I’m okay with that.</p>
