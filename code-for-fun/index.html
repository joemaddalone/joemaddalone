Shit. I was once again in the presence of a project I was going to bail on. I'd write a few comments, make a half-hearted attempt at ear-marking the code as the utmost important thing to get to... when I had more time to think. This led to some internal guilt. Then wondered why I was building it at all? Why do I even bother?</p><p>I went back and looked at the iterations of the code and deduced that my intent was to learn.</p><p>And this is the basis of my relationship with coding as a hobby. When not for work I code to learn, and indeed I had learned some new bits and pieces while building this thing I may or may not ever finish... or may have never intended to finish. Sometimes just learning what it would take to fully complete the project is enough.</p><p>This led to the following mental models of my flow when I code in my free time:</p><ul><li><strong>Mechanic</strong><ul><li>Mastery of the tools that exist.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Intellectual</strong><ul><li>A deep understanding of the tools that exists.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wizard</strong><ul><li>Creating new tools.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kiddie</strong><ul><li>I just want to push all the buttons, pull all the levers, and see what they do.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Just for shiggles, here's some <s>dumb shit</s> learning I did and ended up sharing.</h3><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/joemaddalone/pipper">pipper</a><ul><li>Makes dice dots, also called pips</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joemaddalone/set-calculator">set-calculator</a><ul><li>Calculates weights and plates for 5/3/1 lifting program.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joemaddalone/array-areas">array-areas</a><ul><li>Makes shapes in 2D arrays</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joemaddalone/array-trails">array-trails</a><ul><li>Moves through 2D arrays</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joemaddalone/commit-flow">commit-flow</a><ul><li>Uses commitizen to convert our commit policy into a terminal form</li></ul></li></ul><p>I have so many more of these in horrible and outdated shape that I would never bother to share. These few are reasonable examples of code I took to a good enough point. As in good enough for whatever I needed at the time. They could all be improved in various ways... and I may or may not ever get to those iprovements. And I'm okay with that.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Make dumb shit.
